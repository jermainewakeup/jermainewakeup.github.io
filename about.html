        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I started making music in the 8th grade because of Lil B. At that time, I found his music funny, and it inspired me to explore my creativity. I admire his amateurish style and positive energy, which have influenced my own musical journey.</p>
        <p>Through my music, I aim to bring joy and a sense of humor, much like Lil B did for me when I was just starting out. I believe that music should be fun and accessible to everyone.</p>
